# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains programming exercises and small projects completed as part of my Computer Programming A.S. degree at **Solano Community College**.  
Each project focuses on building a deeper understanding of how data structures and algorithms work through hands-on coding practice.

## 🧩 Projects

| Project | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Reverse Number Array** | Reverses the order of elements in an integer array using loops and index manipulation. |
| **Array List Sort** | Implements sorting algorithms to arrange numerical data in ascending or descending order. |
| **Binary Search** | Efficiently searches for a target value within a sorted array using the divide-and-conquer method. |
| **Random Password Generator** | Generates randomized passwords based on user-defined criteria (length, character set, etc.). |
